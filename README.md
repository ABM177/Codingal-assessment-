This ReactJS project features a responsive navigation bar equipped with a countdown timer and a modal for additional interactions. The countdown timer begins at 10 minutes, decrementing each second, and can be paused or ended via a modal. Additionally, the project includes a posts page that fetches data from an external API and displays it with infinite scrolling for pagination.
